  My first thanks go to S\'{a}ndor T\'{o}th, David Butman, Zelda Zabinsky, and Art Chaovalitwongse for their advising of this research, with a special thanks to S\'{a}ndor for his emphasizing my personal growth as a graduate student while in his lab and for regularly reminding me of the bigger picture. I also want to thank Svetlana Schroder for introducing me to the Deschutes case study and her continued support throughout.
  
I would also like to acknowledge all those who contributed to the tools or data used in this study, such as Heather Roberts with the LEMMA team at Oregon State University; Bill Elliot from the US Forest Service's WEPP team; Mike, Lance, and others with the FVS and Climate-FVS teams; the developers for CPLEX, D3, and pandas; and many others. I also want to thank those who have funded my graduate research, including QERM, the Precision Forestry Cooperative, and the US Forest Service.
  
I would also like to thank my labmates and fellow QERMies for acting as sounding boards and for many good times at soup. Finally, my most heartfelt thanks to my family -- to my parents and grandparents for instilling in me the importance of education and the excitement that curiosity can bring, and to my wife, whose endless moral (and financial) support has made my graduate education possible.
