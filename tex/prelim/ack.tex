  My first thanks go to S\'{a}ndor T\'{o}th, David Butman, and Art Chaovalitwongse for their advising of this research. A special thanks goes to S\'{a}ndor for his emphasizing my personal growth as a graduate student and for constantly reminding me of the big picture. I also want to thank Svetlana Schroder for introducing me to the project and her continued support throughout. I would also like to acknowledge all those who contributed to the tools or data used in this study, such as Heather Roberts with the LEMMA team at Oregon State University; Bill Elliot from the US Forest Service's WEPP team; Mike, Lance, and others with the FVS and Climate-FVS teams; the developers for CPLEX, D3, and pandas; and many others. I also want to thank those who have funded my graduate research, including QERM, the Precision Forestry Cooperative, and the US Forest Service.
  
I would also like to thank my labmates and fellow QERMies for acting as sounding boards and for many good times at soup. Finally, my most heartfelt thanks to my family -- to my parents and grandparents for instilling in me the importance of curiosity and education, and to my wife, whose endless moral (and financial) support has made my graduate education possible.
