% MY RESEARCH:
%% Model forest growth under different climate projections
%% Consider: Sediment delivery, fire risk, owl habitat in each scenario
%% Given these growth conditions, we want to determine how to reduce fire hazard while still maintaining respectable levels of sediment delivery and owl habitat
%% Spatial optimization
%% Not planning on doing stochastic programming, but not ruling it out completely at this point
%% Deterministic

This one looks unnervingly close to what we're proposing at first glance.
Upon quick review, appears to compare efficient frontiers under alternate policy regimes, rather than on climate regimes
At second glance, all curves are "economic tradeoff curves" and are bi-objective ($$ vs. bird, $$ vs. %old growth)
Does not consider changing frontiers with changing climate, but rather changing frontiers with changing environmental policy
Liked this quote: "quantitative understanding of the tradeoffs between marketed products and environmental quality"

Uses "grey systems theory" (with mathematical programming) to address uncertainty in climate indicators. Case study is agricultural expansion in the Mackenzie River Basin. Should read more thoroughly to be better informed, but does not study climate change as a driver of change in forest management (nor is it multi-objective or compare tradeoffs)

Optimization for conservation with multiple objectives. Will update description after reading.
Update: Did not read entire article, but enough to grasp the following:

Uses progressive hedging in stochastic modeling (solve each scenario of a stochastic problem in isolation and then combine - in iteration) to solve the problem of harvest scheduling and road construction. Not multi-objective, no comparison of frontiers, no analysis of changing tradeoffs. Ours answers a more ecological question compared to this piece.

At first glance, appears to be considering how to visualize efficient solutions when 3+ objectives are considered. Seems to suggest using 2D-slices. Is this really all the novelty happening here?
Multiobjective forest management problem and assesses resulting tradeoffs in the solution, but no comparison of objectives.
Claims to be able to do some fancy searching of the feasible space to provide interactive and animated visualization of the Pareto frontier generated by the ERM (Lotov et al. 2004).
