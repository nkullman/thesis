\chapter{Running \LaTeX\\
  ({\it and printing if you must})}
 
 
From a given source \TeX\ will produce exactly the same document
on all computers and, if needed, on all printers.  {\it Exactly the same}
means that the various spacings, line and page breaks, and
even hyphenations will occur at the same places.

How you edit your text files and run \LaTeX\ varies
from system to system and depends on your personal preference.

\section{Running}

The author is woefully out of his depth where 
\TeX\ on Windows is concerned.  Google would be his resource.
On a linux system he types

\begin{lstlisting}
\$\ pdflatex uwthesis
\end{lstlisting}

and it generally works.

 
\section{Printing}
 
All implementations of \TeX\ provide the option of {\bf pdf} output,
which is all the Graduate School requires.  Even if you intend to
print a copy of your thesis create a 
{\tt pdf}.  It will print most anywhere.
