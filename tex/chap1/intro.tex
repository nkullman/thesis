% ======== Introduction to Deschutes National Forest case study

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
 
Forests play an important role in global ecological, social, and economic processes. They provide ecosystem services such as carbon storage, purification of water and air, wildlife habitat, recreation opportunities, and generate raw materials for goods such as food and lumber \cite{daily1997ecosystem}. In managed forests, the extent to which forests provide these services depends in part on management practices. Forest management seeks to ensure the sustained provision of these ecosystem services \cite{cfrForestMgmt}.

Like other ecosystems, forests will undergo changes as a result of the changing climate. Researchers anticipate new spatial distributions of tree species \cite{iverson1998predicting}, increased sediment delivery to streams \cite{Goode20121}, and increasing disturbance regimes such as wildfires, droughts, and insect infestations \cite{vose2012effects}. As this transformation occurs, the ability of forests to provide ecosystem services will change. Increased frequency of disturbance regimes will impact the ability of forests to store carbon \cite{bonan2008forests} and provide wildlife habitat \cite{mckenzie2004climatic}. Water supplies that rely on forests' filtration capabilities may be impacted by the rising sediment levels predicted by Goode \textit{et al.} \cite{Goode20121}.

As a result, forest planners may need to consider the effects of the changing climate. Linder \cite{linder2000developing} has shown that optimal forest management strategies vary depending on which future climate scenario is assumed. To determine whether and how forest planners need to adapt to climate change, many studies have addressed the effects of climate change on isolated ecosystem services \cite{vose2012effects}\cite{bonan2008forests}\cite{mckenzie2004climatic}. However, forests provide these ecosystem services in concert with one another (see, for example, T{\'o}th and McDill \cite{toth2009finding}), and little research has been done to understand how climate change impacts the relationships among or the joint provision of ecosystem services. I posit that improvements in this understanding would enable better and more informed forest management decisions.

To improve our understanding of the impacts of climate change on the joint provision of ecosystem services, I propose the use of multi-objective mathematical optimization. Multi-objective optimization has been used in numerous forest management studies involving multiple ecosystem services \cite{schroder2016multi}\cite{toth2009finding}\cite{diaz2008making}\cite{borges2014addressing}. The application of multi-objective optimization in these studies reveals the relationships among ecosystem services. When the studies consider competing or ``bundled'' ecosystem services, multi-objective optimization produces a set of Pareto optimal management alternatives that reveal the trade-offs among the ecosystem services and allow for the quantification of conflict. In such cases, the competition among the ecosystem services prevents the simultaneous maximal provision of all ecosystem services. Instead, trade-offs must be made, where the provision of one or multiple ecosystem services must be reduced in order to increase provision of another. Timber revenues and wildlife habitat provide an example of bundled ecosystem services. In these cases, the optimal management strategy involves finding the best compromise alternatives.

Heterogeneous forcing from climate change on forest ecosystem services will likely also change the trade-off relationships among ecosystem services. This has the potential to disrupt the balance among ecosystem services that define the compromise alternatives from which forest planers choose. In other words, under different climatic conditions, decisions that would once have resulted in a preferred balance among ecosystem services may no longer do so. Without consideration of climate change, forest management plans may restrict the potential for forests to provide ecosystem services most effectively. For instance, would the same amount of old-growth forest have to be converted to fire breaks to ensure a given reduction in fire hazard under various climate projections? Would carbon sequestration cost the same in terms of foregone timber revenues under a changing climate as it does today? To quantify the impacts of climate change on the trade-off relationships among and the joint provision of forest ecosystem services, I employ multi-objective optimization on a case study of the Drink Area, located in the Deschutes National Forest.

In section \ref{sec:methods} I define conflict and relationships among ecosystem services and then describe a case study in which these are evaluated. Section \ref{sec:results} reports and discusses the results. Finally, I summarize and draw closing remarks in section \ref{sec:conclusion}.

%, few have considered its impact on the joint provision of multiple ecosystem services. Understanding the relationships among ecosystem services is important Since forests provide these ecosystem services in concert with one another (see, for example, T{\'o}th and McDill \cite{toth2009finding}), understanding how climate may impact the relationships among them may enable forest planners to make more informed management decisions. This is of particular interest to forest planners seeking the simultaneous provision of multiple competing ecosystem services, or ``bundled'' ecosystem services. Bundled ecosystem services compete with one another, and their joint provision requires trade-offs. That is, one or multiple ecosystem services must be sacrificed in order to achieve more of another. Timber revenues and wildlife habitat provide an example of bundled ecosystem services. In such cases, the optimal management strategy involves finding the best compromise alternatives. % (In contrast, ``stacked'' ecosystem services are those that are not in conflict, such as the provision of old growth forest and northern spotted owl habitat - an improvement in one ecosystem service also improves the others in the stack. Stacked ecosystem services do not present a management challenge, since the same management practices bring about positive change for all ecosystem services. \textit{IS THIS PARENTHESIZED TEXT NEEDED?})
%Does discussing bundles vs stacks just beg the question of whether bundles remain bundles or stacks remain stacks? Our research does not address this, so this is a dangerous question to beg.
%
%In the case of bundled ecosystem services, the optimal management strategy achieves a balance among the provision of the ecosystem services. The ``goodness'' of the balance - as measured by its proximity to the ideal situation in which all ecosystem services are maximally provided - depends on the ecosystem services and the degree of conflict that exists amongst them. In the case of weakly competing ecosystem services, a near-ideal management plan may exist such that all ecosystem services are attained near their maximal value. In the case of strongly competing ecosystem services, significant trade-offs must be made to achieve the balance in which at least one ecosystem service is provided at a value far from its optimum. As climate change is predicted to impact forests' ability to provide ecosystem services, the trade-off relationships among the ecosystem services will likely also change as a result of heterogeneous forcing from climate change on forest ecosystem services. This change has the potential to disrupt the balance among ecosystem services that forest planners have historically sought to achieve.
%
%For INSTANCE  - in this case study, how about the way that these ESs are in balance and what if it were to change. What about this other case study? What about this one? What about this one IN THE DRINK?
%
%As a result, forest managers may need to consider the effects of the changing climate, since %the time scale of forest development is of the same order as that on which climate change is predicted to operate \cite{ipcc2013climate}
%climate change is predicted to impact optimal forest management \cite{linder2000developing}. Decisions that would once have resulted in a preferred balance among ecosystem services, now under different climatic conditions, may no longer do so. Without consideration of climate change, forest management plans may restrict the potential for forests to provide ecosystem services most effectively. For instance, would the same amount of old-growth forest have to be converted to fire breaks to ensure a given reduction in fire hazard under various climate projections? Would c arbon sequestration cost the same in terms of foregone timber revenues under a changing climate as it does today?
%
%In this work, I quantify the impacts of climate change on the trade-off relationships among ecosystem services using multi-objective mathematical optimization. An area in the Deschutes National Forest serves as a case study. I posit generally that a better understanding of how climate change will impact trade-off relationships will allow forest planners to make more informed management decisions going forward.
%
%In section \ref{sec:methods} I describe the case study and the bundle of ecosystem services considered, discuss the future climates considered, and introduce the mathematical optimization model. Section \ref{sec:results} reports and discusses the results. Finally, I summarize and draw closing remarks in section \ref{sec:conclusion}.
%
%In the coming sections, I describe and motivate the case study, then motivate and describe the model.
%
%Then in the methods section, I had this note on the transitioning from case study to model:With these ESs, what are we going.
%
%There are these ESs. Then there's climate change. We're concerned  
%
%A good review to do - take an optimal solution to the NONE model (the values of the x vars, p vars, etc), and see what it would achieve in the E45 and E85 models (hoping to show that it would not have been a frontier point)

%\subsection{A hypothetical scenario}
%To understand how trade-off relationships impact management strategies and ecosystem service provision, consider the following hypothetical scenario in which a forest planner manages for old forest habitat and wildfire hazard. Historically, serves as prime habitat for a threatened bird species. The forest manager's primary objective is the conservation of this species, but the manager also performs the minimum amount of harvests necessary to offset the costs of property ownership from timber sales.  To determine which stands to harvest, the manager ran an analysis, ignoring climate change, that suggested the harvest of a small set of stands near the northern perimeter of the forest as it was most accessible, served only as mediocre habitat for the bird species, and was dense with merchantable timber.
%
%Now, climate change is reducing the area of the forest that is suitable habitat for the threatened bird species. Much of the species' remaining habitat is the area on the northern perimeter of the forest that has traditionally been harvested. Simultaneously, longer growing seasons and warmer temperatures are increasing the timber stock of other areas of the forest, making the northern stands less relatively advantageous to harvest. The manager, unaware, continues harvests in the northern stands, damaging much of what remains of the bird species' habitat.
%
%With each ecosystem service modeled in isolation, this conflict is not fully understood, and optimal alternatives will not be discovered. Modeled in concert, however, the forest manager would have realized that these objectives do not strongly conflict with one another - if the manager were to move the harvests to the stands near the forest's eastern perimeter, his harvests would increase only slightly while also retaining nearly all of the bird species's suitable habitat. In other words, a marginal sacrifice in one ecosystem service allows for a significant improvement in another. Without knowledge of this trade-off structure, the manager is unnecessarily impeding the bird species's climate-driven rangeshift.
%
%It is the impact of climate change on such trade-off structures that I investigate in this work. I consider as a case study an area in the Deschutes National Forest known as the Drink Planning Area, or the Drink area, in which we attempt to maximize the provision of the following ecosystem services: area of habitat available to the northern spotted owl, water quality in the watershed, and reduction in fire hazard.
