% ======== Introduction to Deschutes National Forest case study

\section{Introduction}
 
Forests play an important role in global ecological, social, and economic processes. They provide ecosystem services such as carbon storage, purification of water and air, wildlife habitat, recreation opportunities, and generate raw materials for goods such as food and lumber \cite{daily1997ecosystem}. In managed forests, the extent to which forests provide these services depends on management practices. Optimal forest management seeks to ensure the sustained provision of these ecosystem services (!CITE bibtex'ed CFR source).

Like other ecosystems, forests will undergo changes as a result of the changing climate. Researchers anticipate new spatial distributions of tree species \cite{iverson1998predicting}, increased sediment delivery to streams \cite{Goode20121}, and increasing disturbance regimes such as wildfires, drought, and insect infestation \cite{vose2012effects}. As this transformation occurs, forests’ ability to provide ecosystem services will change. NEW GROWING CONDITIONS MAY LEAD TO INC/DEC TIMBER PRODUCTION. TEMPERATURES MAY POSITION FORESTS AS HABITAT FOR MORE/FEWER SPECIES. Increased frequency of wildfires will impact forests’ ability to store carbon \cite{bonan2008forests} and provide habitat for wildlife \cite{mckenzie2004climatic}. Water supplies that rely on forests’ filtration capabilities may be impacted by the rising sediment levels predicted by \cite{Goode20121}.

Optimal forest management must consider the effects of the changing climate, because the time scale of forest development (decades) is the same as that on which climate change is predicted to operate (!CITE SOME REPORT that shows changes by late 21st century). Hence, optimal forest management will likely differ between future climate scenarios !CITE climate change forest management papers. Decisions that would once have resulted in optimal achievement of ecosystem services, now under different climatic conditions, may no longer do so. Without consideration of climate change, forest management plans may restrict forests' potential to provide ecosystem services most effectively. To determine which management practices will be optimal in the future, we must first understand how climate change will impact forests' ability to provide ecosystem services. For example, how many tons of carbon dioxide will the forest be capable of storing? How many acres of forest will still qualify as suitable habitat for a particular species? Many studies have considered these questions !CITE SOME PEOPLE.

However, previous studies have addressed the impact of climate change on forest ecosystem services in isolation. Because forests provide these ecosystem services in concert with one another (see, for example, \cite{toth2009finding}), we must also understand how climate impacts the tradeoffs that exist among them. Consider the simultaneous provision of wildlife habitat, carbon storage, and resistance to wildfire. How does an increase in any one service alter our ability to acquire an amount of another? Relationships such as a marginal sacrifice in one service for substantial improvement in another may no longer exist under a new climate. To better ensure the sustained provision of ecosystem services, we must understand how these tradeoffs evolve as a function of climate.

Here, I use a watershed in the Deschutes National Forest as a case study to determine how climate change impacts optimal forest management and the changes in tradeoffs among ecosystem services.

TO TEST ALL THIS STUFF, I AM USING A STUDY AREA IN THE DESCHUTES NATIONAL FOREST, KNOWN AS THE DRINK AREA. IT IS THIS BIG AND IS DIVIDED INTO 303 FOREST STANDS. THE AREA CONTAINS THE WATERSHED FOR THE CITIES OF BEND AND SISTERS OREGON. IT IS COMPRISED OF OLD GROWTH AND NEW GROWTH AND SOME OTHER STUFF. IT IS FLAMMABLE. WE WANT TO REDUCE THE RISK OF LONGTERM, SEVERE DEGRADATION OF THE WATER SUPPLIES TO THESE CITIES THAT WOULD RESULT FROM A HIGH SEVERITY WILDFIRE. THIS IS OUR FIRST OBJECTIVE. WE WILL DO THIS BY PERFORMING FUEL TREATMENTS. BUT THESE FUEL TREATMENTS LEAD TO SHORTERM SPIKES IN SEDIMENT CONTENT IN THE WATERSUPPLY, WHICH WE AIM TO MINIMIZE. MINIMIZING THE SEDIMENT DELIVERY TO THE WATERSHED AS A RESULT OF THE TREATMENTS IS OUR SECOND OBJECTIVE. FINALLY, THE AREA IS HOME TO THE FEDERALLY PROTECTED NORTHERN SPOTTED OWL. OUR THIRD OBJECTIVE IS ENSURING MAXIMAL HABITAT FOR THE NSO. WE WANT TO TEST OUR ABILITY TO SIMULTANEOUSLY PROCURE THESE THREE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES IN THE LONGTERM. BY LONGTERM, I MEAN I WILL STUDY IT OVER AN 80 YEAR HORIZON FROM 2015-2095. ALL MANAGEMENT ACTIVITY WILL OCCUR DURING THE INITIAL 40 YEARS. BC THE AREA GROWS SLOWLY, WE MODEL THESE 40 YEARS IN TWO 20-YEAR PLANNING HORIZONS. THE MANAGEMENT ACTIONS THAT MAY BE PRESCRIBED ARE THINNING TREATMENTS (SEE APPENDIX \_ FOR TREATMENT PRESCRIPS) AND ARE DETERMINED APRIORI FOR EACH STAND AND TIME PERIOD COMBINATION. WE MEASURE THE SPIKE IN SEDIMENT DELIVERY AT THE TIME OF TREATMENT (YEARS 2025 AND 2045). WE MEASURE THE ACHIEVEMENT IN NSO HABITAT AND FIRE HAZARD AT THE END OF THE 80 YEAR PLANNING HORIZON. WE WILL DO THIS FOR EACH OF THREE DIFFERENT CLIMATE CHANGE SCENARIOS.

THE RESULTS WILL ENABLE US TO STUDY THE TRADEOFFS AMONG THESE THREE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AND SEE HOW THEY VARY WITH CLIMATE CHANGE.
