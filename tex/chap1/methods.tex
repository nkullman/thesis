\section{Methods}
 
In this thesis the typist
refers to the user of \LaTeX---the one who
makes formatting decisions and chooses the appropriate
formatting commands.
He or she will most often be the degree candidate.
 
This document deals with \LaTeX\ typesetting commands and their
functions.  Wherever possible the conventions used to display
text entered by the typist and the resulting formatted output
are the same as those used by the \TeX books.
Therefore, {\tt typewriter type} is used to indicate text
as typed by the computer
or entered by the typist.
It is quite the opposite of {\it italics,} which indicates
a category rather than exact text.  For example,
{\tt alpha} and {\tt beta} might each be an example of a {\it label}.
